This \nguidance is continually updated as more data beco\nmes available and includes advice on sample collection, diagnostic \ntesting, and pathogen characterization. Specific \ninterim guidance on biosafety in the labo\nratory\n \nhas also been \npublished\n. A\nn update \nto\n \nthe guidance for the international shipment of specimens will follow soon. WHO is utilizing \nan international network of expert laboratories to provide support in the detection of the COVID\n-\n19 virus globally.\n \n \nFi\ngure 2. WHO international reference laboratories for the COVID\n-\n19 virus.\n \n \n \nThe diagnostic landscape of this outbreak is changing quickly. The first COVID\n-\n19 cases were detected using genomic \nsequencing, but multiple RT\n-\nPCR commercial and \nnon\n-\ncommercial assays have since been developed. As the \ninternational case load increases, there is an urgent need to rapidly scale up diagnostic capacity to detect and \nconfirm cases\n \nof COVID\n-\n19\n. WHO has taken a three\n-\npronged approach to enhance global dia\ngnostic capacity for the \nCOVID\n-\n19 virus: \n \n \n1)\n \nDeveloping a WHO network of 15 COVID\n-\n19 reference laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the \nmolecular detection of coronaviruses. These international laboratories can support national labs to confirm \nthe COV\nID\n-\n19 virus and troubleshoot their molecular assays.\n \n \n2)\n \nStrengthening national capacity for detection of the COVID\n-\n19 virus so that diagnostic testing can be \nperformed rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. Existing global networks for detection of \nrespiratory pathogens are being utilized \nincl\nuding\n, notably, the National Influenza Centers that support the \nGlobal Influenza Surveillance and Response System.\n \n \n3)\n \nEnsuring ongoing test availability. WHO has procured a commercial assay (manufactured under ISO\n:13485) \nwith strong performance data and shipped to over 150 laboratories globally as an interim measure for \nMember States requesting support. The main goal is to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for detection of \nthe COVID\n-\n19 virus. Support is now als\no provided to ensure the quality of testing through the \nimplementation of an External Quality Assurance mechanism.\n \n \nPublic health efforts are targeted at both interrupting further transmission and monitoring the spread\n \nof COVID\n-\n19\n. \nAs reports of asymptomat\nic cases increase, the need for reliable serology testing is becoming more urgent. There are \na number of groups working on this and developments are being monitored.\n \n\n====End of 2 Page====\n====Starting of 3 Page====\n \n \nSURVEILLANCE\n \n \n \nTable\n \n1\n.\n \nConfirmed\n \nand suspected\n \ncases of \nCOVID\n-\n19\n \nacute respirato\nry disease reported by provinces, regions and \ncities \nin China, \n2\n7\n \nFebruary 2020\n \nProvince/ \n \nRegion/ \n \nCity\n \nPopulation \n(10,000s)\n \nDaily\n \nCumulative\n \nConfirmed \ncases\n \n \nSuspected \ncases\n \n \nDeaths\n \nConfirmed \ncases\n \nDeaths\n \nHubei\n \n5917\n \n409\n \n403\n \n26\n \n65596\n \n2641\n \nGuangdong\n \n11346\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n1347\n \n7\n \nHenan\n \n9605\n \n1\n \n2\n \n1\n \n1272\n \n20\n \nZhejiang\n \n5737\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n1205\n \n1\n \nHunan\n \n6899\n \n1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n1017\n \n4\n \nAnhui\n \n6324\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n989\n \n6\n \nJiangxi\n \n4648\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n934\n \n1\n \nShandong\n \n10047\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n756\n \n6\n \nJiangsu\n \n8051\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n631\n \n0\n \nChongqing\n \n3102\n \n0\n \n11\n \n0\n \n576\n \n6\n \nSichuan\n \n8341\n \n3\n \n4\n \n0\n \n534\n \n3\n \nHeilongjiang\n \n3773\n \n0\n \n0\n \n1\n \n480\n \n13\n \nBeijing\n \n2154\n \n10\n \n10\n \n1\n \n410\n \n5\n \nShanghai\n \n2424\n \n1\n \n33\n \n0\n \n337\n \n3\n \nHebei\n \n7556\n \n5\n \n0\n \n0\n \n317\n \n6\n \nFujian\n \n3941\n \n2\n \n0\n \n0\n \n296\n \n1\n \nGuangxi\n \n4926\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n252\n \n2\n \nShaanxi\n \n3864\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n245\n \n1\n \nYunnan\n \n4830\n \n0\n \n3\n \n0\n \n174\n \n2\n \nHainan\n \n934\n \n0\n \n4\n \n0\n \n168\n \n5\n \nGuizhou\n \n3600\n \n0\n \n1\n \n0\n \n146\n \n2\n \nTianjin\n \n1560\n \n0\n \n20\n \n0\n \n135\n \n3\n \nShanxi\n \n3718\n \n0\n \n1\n \n0\n \n133\n \n0\n \nLiaoning\n \n4359\n \n0\n \n14\n \n0\n \n121\n \n1\n \nJilin\n \n2704\n \n0\n \n2\n \n0\n \n93\n \n1\n \nGansu\n \n2637\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n91\n \n2\n \nHong Kong SAR\n \n745\n \n6\n \n0\n \n0\n \n91\n \n2\n \nXinjiang\n \n2487\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n76\n \n2\n \nInner Mongolia\n \n2534\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n75\n \n0\n \nNingxia\n \n688\n \n1\n \n0\n \n0\n \n72\n \n0\n \nTaipei and environs\n \n2359\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n32\n \n1\n \nQinghai\n \n603\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n18\n \n0\n \nMacao SAR\n \n66\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n10\n \n0\n \nXizang\n \n344\n \n0\n \n0\n \n0\n \n1\n \n0\n \nTotal\n \n142823\n \n439\n \n508\n \n29\n \n78630\n \n2747\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n====End of 3 Page====\n====Starting of 4 Page====\n \n \nTable\n \n2\n.

The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance\n \nand case \ndefinitions, to characterize the k\ney epidemiological transmission features of \nCOVID\n-\n19,\n \nhelp understand spread, \nseverity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to\n \ninform operational models for implementation of \ncountermeasures such as case isolation, contact\n \ntracing and isolatio\nn.\n \nSeveral protocols are available here: \nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel\n-\ncoronavirus\n-\n2019/technical\n-\nguidance/early\n-\ninvest\nigations\n \n \n\n \nWHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, \nepidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the \ndisease and \ninterrupt \nonward tr\nansmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, \nwhich are \nupdated \nregularly\n.\n \n\n \nWHO is working with \nglobal expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, infection prevention and control, \nclinical management and mathematical modelling.\n \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE\n \nFOR THE PUBLIC\n \n \nIf you are not in an area where COVID\n-\n19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have \nnot been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it \nare currently low. \n\nfacts to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See \nFrequently Asked \nQuestions\n) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential \nsources of accurate information on COVID\n-\n19 and whether it is in your are\na. It is important to be informed of the \nsituation where you live and take appropriate measures to protect yourself. (See  \nProtection measures for \neveryone\n).\n \nIf you are in an area where there is an outbreak of CO\nVID\n-\n19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow \nthe advice issued by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID\n-\n19 causes only mild \nillness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.\n \nOlder people, and those with pre\n-\nexisting medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable. \n(See \nProtection measures for persons who are in or have rece\nntly visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID\n-\n19 is \nspreading\n).\n \n \n \n\n====End of 8 Page====\n"
